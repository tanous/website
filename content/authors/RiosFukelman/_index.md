bio: |
  I am a researcher in Theoretical Physics from Argentina. After completing my Licenciatura in Buenos Aires, I pursued a PhD at the Institute of Cosmos Sciences, University of Barcelona, under the supervision of Bartomeu Fiol, focusing on exact results in superconformal field theories through matrix model techniques. I then joined King’s College London as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, where I worked on quantum field theory in accelerating spacetimes and helped establish the first solvable QFT in de Sitter spacetime. I am now part of Prof. Tarek Anous’ group at Queen Mary University of London, developing models to advance our understanding of de Sitter spacetime.
