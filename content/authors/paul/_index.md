Hi, I am a researcher in theoretical physics. I grew up in West Bengal, India. I completed my PhD in physics at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru. I worked on quantum gravity in de Sitter spacetime under the supervision of Prof. Suvrat Raju.

After my PhD, I recently joined Queen Mary University of London (School of Mathematical Sciences) as a postdoctoral research assistant. Here, I am part of the research group led by Prof. Tarek Anous.

To learn more about my research & activities, please visit my [iNSPIREHEP profile](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2063851?ui-citation-summary=true) or my [website.](https://sites.google.com/view/priyadarshipaul)
