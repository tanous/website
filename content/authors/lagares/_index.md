I am a theoretical physics researcher from Argentina. I earned a Licentiate degree in Physics from the National University of La Plata (Argentina), where I also completed my PhD in Physics under the supervision of Prof. Diego Correa. During my PhD I undertook three research visits—totaling fifteen months—at the Max Planck Institute for Physics (Germany), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Johannes Henn. My research interests focus on the study of methods to go beyond the paradigm of the Feynman diagram expansion of observables. More specifically, I am interested in the study and development of non-perturbative methods and alternative perturbative formulations in the framework of quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetimes.
