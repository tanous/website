       One of the landmark pursuits of theoretical physics is to quantize the gravitational interaction. String theory provides a perturbative approach, but requires extra particles, symmetries, and spacetime dimensions. Worst of all, string theory fails as a framework in expanding spacetimes---and it just so happens that our universe is [expanding at an exponential rate](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2011/summary/).

       Luckily, string theory has led to the development of _holographic dualities_, such as the AdS/CFT correspondence (learn about it [here](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/aw846/AdSCFT.html)), which posits that spacetime physics emerges as a strong-coupling, many-body limit of quantum systems that do not interact gravitationally. 

       My research aims to understand how spacetime horizon physics is encoded using such dualities, and explore models that incorporate the expansion of spacetime. Some approaches that I have taken in the past include: 

       - Quantum field theory *on a rigid de Sitter background*, e.g.:
          - Finding [exactly solvable models](/publication/anninos-2024-fty/)
          - Studying the constraints imposed by [symmetries](/publication/anninos-2023-lin) and [unitarity](/publication/anous-2020-nxu)
          - Analyzing the cosmological wavefunction and how it controls the [infrared of loop integrals](/publication/anninos-2014-lwa)
       - Low-dimensional models of classical and quantum gravity, and their holographic duals, e.g.: 
          - Following the process of thermalization after a global quench and demonstrating it as a [dual process to gravitational black hole collapse](/publication/anous-2016-kss)
       - Proposing supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanical systems as [toy models](/publication/anous-2019-rqb) for [string theoretic black holes](/publication/anous-2017-mwr)
       - Suggesting disordered systems as a model of [cold](/publication/anous-2021-eqj) or [fragmented black holes](/publication/anninos-2016-szt)
